Boggle
======

Boggle is a word game that is played on a 4x4 board with 16 letter tiles.

The goal is to find as many words as possible given a time constraint.

In this version of Boggle, we are making one modification. Now it is possible
for one or more of the letter tiles to be blank (denoted by `*`).

When a tile is blank, it can be treated as any other letter. Note that in one
game it does not have to be the same character for each word.

For example, if the tiles C, T, and * are adjacent. The words cot, cat, and cut
can all be used.
